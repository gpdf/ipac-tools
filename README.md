# ipac-tools
Experimental and other small tools for use in an IPAC context

Currently:

* `exes-to-votable.py` is a converter for data from the SOFIA EXES instrument, going from the native data product file formats to modern VOTable format, with enough metadata to allow display using Firefly's generic capabilities.  The context is a sketch of a design for the SOFIA archive to provide on-the-fly format conversions, perhaps discovered via DataLink.
